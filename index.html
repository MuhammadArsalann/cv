                <h1>Muhammad Arsalan</h1><p> <em>Founder and CTO of <strong>SoftTech.Inc</strong>.</em> </p><p>I am fascinated by how computer technology has brought changes to
                    our lives that could never have been predicted; witnessing the 
                    expansion of computer science allowed me to consider studying 
                    software engineering from an <strong>early age of 14</strong>, and my enthusiasm 
                    has perpetually developed since this time. Starting with <strong>C++</strong> at
                    the age of 14 year, then <strong>html, CSS, JavaScript</strong> at home and having 
                    successfully creating different websites and backend logics. 
                    Then I learnt <strong> react Js, react native</strong> and <strong>finally flutter</strong>, with 
                    the aid of this demonstrates my self-motivation in learning <strong>software engineering</strong>
                    at university, and the fundamental skills I have imputed
                    into this supports my pursuit of studying this course. Then I start
                    working with IoT devices and successfully created a self-intelligent
                    system for water level indication and auto on/off water pump with the
                    facility of voltage observation for my home, these techniques will aid
                    my work during my further studies of software engineering, I look 
                    forward to developing these pre-existing aptitudes and learning as 
                    much as possible during my time at university.</p>
